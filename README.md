### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brendan 

I'm a self-taught Software Developer eager to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology. My professional journey began as a Scuba Diving Instructor, certifying hundreds of students and eventually achieving the highest rank in the professional instructor realm as a <a href="https://www.padi.com/courses/course-director">PADI Course Director</a>. As a diving professional, I was passionate about improving safety in the industry and served for 3 years as the Diving Safety Officer for UCBC, where I analyzed accident reports and made recommendations. Throughout my career, I led guided dive trips worldwide, organizing and spearheading group expeditions to destinations like Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Mexico. After 14 years of managing the oldest dive club in Canada at the University of British Columbia and dedicating myself to full-time scuba diving instruction, I decided to pivot into the world of technology.

Currently, I specialize in providing tech solutions for small businesses in my role at Plan 2 Development. I'm passionate about topics related to security, privacy, and using technology to increase individual autonomy and agency. I'm actively pursuing the AWS Solutions Architect Certification and honing my skills in the Django and Wordpress technology stack.

One of my recent projects, <a href='https://seasavvydiver.com'>https://seasavvydiver.com</a> is a website that collects and distributes up-to-date scuba diving equipment information from the top Canadian online retailers, helping users make informed purchasing decisions with confidence.

Another personal project of mine is <a href="https://github.com/BAndresen/TOJA">Toja</a>, an open-source desktop application written in Python that helps users track and optimize their job applications. Users earn points with each new event and level up, motivating them to persist with the job search. Toja also utilizes Natural Language Processing to search the user's job database for keywords, discovering in-demand skills and providing a unique resume score.

Feel free to explore my GitHub and Projects sections for more details. I'm always eager to connect and discuss opportunities in the tech industry
