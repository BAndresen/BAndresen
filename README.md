### Hi there 👋 I'm Brendan 

I'm a self-taught Software Developer eager to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology. My professional journey began as a Scuba Diving Instructor, certifying hundreds of students and eventually achieving the highest rank in the professional instructor realm as a <a href="https://www.padi.com/courses/course-director">PADI Course Director</a>. As a diving professional, I was passionate about improving safety in the industry and served for 3 years as the Diving Safety Officer for UCBC, where I analyzed accident reports and made recommendations. Throughout my career, I led guided dive trips worldwide, organizing and spearheading group expeditions to destinations like Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Mexico. After 14 years of managing the oldest dive club in Canada at the University of British Columbia and dedicating myself to full-time scuba diving instruction, I decided to pivot into the world of technology.

Currently, I specialize in providing tech solutions for small businesses in my role at Plan 2 Development. I'm passionate about topics related to security, privacy, and using technology to increase individual autonomy. I'm actively pursuing the AWS Solutions Architect Certification and honing my skills in the Django and Wordpress technology stack.

One of my recent projects, <a href='https://seasavvydiver.com'>https://seasavvydiver.com</a> is a website that aggregates scuba diving pricing information from top retailers across Canada. I've developed a bot that scrapes prices from various sites, updating an online database where users can search, compare prices, and view pricing history. With over 13,000 store items to search and 190,000+ price history data points (and counting), users can easily find the best deals. One standout feature is the 'Deals of the Week' section on the homepage, highlighting items with price drops from the previous week.

Another personal project of mine is <a href="https://github.com/BAndresen/TOJA">Toja</a>, an open-source desktop application written in Python designed to assist users in tracking their job prospects. Users can generate visual progress reports, earn points for each step towards their new job, and utilize NLP for keyword searches on their job database to identify in-demand skills sought by employers. Additionally, users can upload their resumes to receive a unique score and receive suggestions on how to optimize their resumes for better ATS scores during applications.

One of my initial projects is the <a href="https://github.com/BAndresen/instructor_assistant">Instructor Assistant</a>, an open-source desktop application designed specifically for PADI scuba instructors to streamline the completion of the PADI Student Record File. This program utilizes autofilling PDFs and other techniques to enhance efficiency in the process.

Feel free to explore my GitHub and Projects sections for more details. I'm always eager to connect and discuss opportunities in the tech industry
